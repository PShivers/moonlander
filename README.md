This is a repo to keep my [Moonlander keyboard](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/) keymaps, configs, etc...

I have made a ton of changes without using version control, but I have mostly settled in and I think I have a good stable jumping off point for fine tuning.
I use Colemak-dh to type but I do keep a dedicated key to quickly switch to QWERTY for normies(AKA reasonable people who don't want to ruin a lifetime of typing skill).

The initial commit contains my most recent change of adding a dedicated key for opening windows dictation app. 
Another custom feature I have implemented is a built in "Autorun" for games that don't natively have one. It toggles the "F" key(I use FRST on Colemak-dh instead of the standard WASD) being held down.
